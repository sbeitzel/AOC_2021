# AOC_2021

This project holds my noodling around on the problems presented in [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I'm writing it all in Swift and rather than making a cheesy command line app (which is the way to go if you're actually trying to do this stuff *quickly*) this is a GUI app using SwiftUI. Still targeting macOS, though.

Note that the app icon is created by [Bakery](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/bakery-simple-icon-creator/id1575220747), which means that the icon uses SF Symbols. Don't use the icon for distribution! Also, I don't hold the copyright to the icon, because SF Symbols! It's just a placeholder!

Anyway, the UI is inspired by [Paul Hudson's](https://hackingwithswift.com) demo of an app to help solve a crypto challenge.
